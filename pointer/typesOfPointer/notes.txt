types of pointer:-

1 -> wind pointer :-  A wild pointer is a type of pointer where, the user declear the pointer but not initalize it.
                      Due to this it ends up pointing to some random memeory loc.
                      Due to this we might get undefined behavior and error. In some cases we might get segmentation fault.
                      eg:- int *ptr;


2 -> NUll pointer :-  if we want to have a pointer variable, which is  just declear but will get address lates to store. we can use null pointer.

eg:-  int *ptr = NULL;


3 :- It is a type of pointer that point to memeory location that is not valid.

4 :- void pointer :- these are special pointers that can point to any datatype value.
                     void pointer cannot be derefrence.
